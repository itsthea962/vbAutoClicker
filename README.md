# vbAutoClicker
An autoclicker &amp; autoscroller created within the excellent VB.NET

It can left click, right click, scroll up and scroll down (incredible)

Custom hotkeys and interval changes also exist here

Feel free to use these files, just credit my GitHub page if you want :-) (it's not like this is all my code anyway lmao)

v1.5 is the latest, v1.4 also available to download
